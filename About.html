<h3>HOG ON which started as Foodiebay, was established in July 2008 by two IIT Delhi alumnus,N.sai saranya, and K.V.sai lakshmi.
The idea struck Deepinder when his colleagues consistently had a demand for paper menu leaflets of different restaurants, to order food.
The online food delivery space in India is dominated by two big players- Zomato and Swiggy. There are other players like Foodpanda, JustEat, TastyKhana and FoodMingo but the competition for the No 1 position is majorly confined between Zomato and Swiggy, backed by big global investors and a large user base.The company, which had once decided not to expand its business, is aiming higher now.
Hog on had to rather pay a dear cost for keeping things put as it saw newbie Swiggy punch holes in its dominance in the Indian food ordering space. In the firm's blog, co-founder Deepinder Goyal shared his larger-than-life future plan of making Zomato the biggest farm to table food company in the world.</h3>
